This plugin is both suitable for one-time donations and for periodic payments. All payment methods of Mollie are integrated into the plugin.

== Description ==

Are you looking for a simple donation plugin for a charity or for example the local football club? This plugin is both suitable for one-time donations and for periodic payments. All payment methods of Mollie are integrated into the plugin. The plugin is also available in several languages: Dutch, English, German and French.

= Features =

Although the plugin is very easy to install, it contains enough options:

* Donations can be found in the WordPress admin panel.
* Donors can enter their details.
* You can specify different projects, so donors can choose which project they want to donate.
* You can choose which data donors should provide for the donation.
* You can set a redirect page yourself.
* You can specify by default the choice of the donor.
* You can style the form as desired.

= Recurring payments =

In addition to one-time donations, this plugin is also useful for collecting periodic amounts. This works on the basis of Mollie's "Subscription API". This system makes it possible, for example, to collect a certain amount monthly, quarterly or annually by credit card or by SEPA Direct Debit.

= Multicurrency =

Let your donors donate in their own currency. Enable this setting so the donor can select a currency when donating, or set a default currency for all donations.

Please take a look at [Mollie Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mollie-forms/) which contains more features to create forms with payments.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* [doneren_met_mollie] To display the form
* [doneren_met_mollie_total] To display the total raised money
* [doneren_met_mollie_total project="My project"] To display the total raised money of a specific project
* [doneren_met_mollie_total start="500.20"] To display the total raised money and start at a specific amount
